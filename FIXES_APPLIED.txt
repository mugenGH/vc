🎯 ASYLUM GAME FIXES APPLIED
==========================

ISSUE FIXED: Game not progressing after asylum collapse

ROOT CAUSE: Scene indexing was broken in goToScene() function

CHANGES MADE:
✅ Fixed scene mapping for scenes 11+ (The Escape and beyond)
✅ Added proper audio switching for epilogue scenes (calm music)
✅ Added safety check to prevent undefined scene errors
✅ Scenes now map correctly:
   - Scene 11 (The Escape) → ✅ Working
   - Scene 12 (Epilogue) → ✅ Working 
   - Scene 13 (Six Months Later) → ✅ Working
   - Scene 14 (One Year Later) → ✅ Working
   - Scene 15 (Credits) → ✅ Working

AUDIO FIXES:
✅ Music now switches to calm/normal during epilogue scenes
✅ Audio controls remain functional throughout
✅ Background music crossfading works properly

HOW TO TEST:
1. Load the game in browser
2. Play through to the asylum collapse
3. Click "Turn off camera and look to the future"
4. Game should now progress smoothly through all epilogue scenes
5. Music should switch from intense to calm atmospheric

The game should now work perfectly from collapse to credits! 🎮✨
