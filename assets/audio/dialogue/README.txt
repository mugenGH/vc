DIALOGUE AUDIO SETUP
====================

Place your dialogue sound effect in this directory as:

speak.mp3 - This sound will play during typewriter text effects
- Should be short (0.1 - 0.5 seconds)  
- Recommended: Typing sound, click, or subtle beep
- Plays repeatedly during dialogue text animation
- Volume automatically set to 50%

SUPPORTED FORMATS: MP3, WAV, OGG
FILE NAME MUST BE EXACT: speak.mp3

If this file is missing, text will still animate but without sound effects.

You can toggle sound effects on/off using the 🔊 button in the game!
