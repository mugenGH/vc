HOW TO ADD AUDIO TO YOUR ASYLUM GAME
=====================================

To enable audio in your horror game, place the following files in this directory:

1. normal.mp3 - This should be your normal/ambient background music
   - Should be longer than 30 seconds and loop-friendly
   - Recommended: Dark ambient, subtle horror atmosphere
   - Volume will be automatically set to 30%

2. sudden.mp3 - This should be your sudden/intense horror music  
   - Plays during high-danger scenes automatically
   - Should be more intense/scary than normal.mp3
   - Volume will crossfade between normal and sudden based on scene danger

SUPPORTED FORMATS: MP3, WAV, OGG
FILE NAMES MUST BE EXACT: normal.mp3 and sudden.mp3

Once you add these files, the game will automatically detect and use them!

If files are missing, the game will continue to work but without background music.
